        <h1><u>Self Intro</u></h1>
        <p>
            I have pursued a well-rounded and progressive academic path in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), supported by strong performances at every stage of my education. <br><br>
            1. Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) – ECE  Institution: Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering and Technology (Autonomous), Chittoor University: Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Ananthapur Year of Completion: 2024 Percentage: 86% <br><br>
            During my B.Tech, I gained both theoretical and practical knowledge in core electronics and communication subjects along with software and programming fundamentals. I actively participated in projects and workshops related to embedded systems, IoT, and web development, which helped me build a strong technical base. I also developed proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Angular during this time. <br><br>
            2. Diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering Institution: Dr. YC James Yan Government Polytechnic College, Kuppam Board: State Board of Technical Education, Andhra Pradesh Year of Completion: 2021 Percentage: 93% <br> <br>
            My diploma education laid the groundwork for understanding the principles of electronics, circuit design, and microcontrollers. The curriculum was practically oriented, giving me hands-on experience with hardware projects and basic programming, which sparked my interest in embedded systems and automation. <br><br>
            3. Secondary School Education (SSC) School: Z.P High School, Kallur Board: Board of Secondary Education, Andhra Pradesh ,Year of Completion: 2018 ,CGPA: 8.7 <br> <br>
            At the school level, I developed a keen interest in science and mathematics, which eventually guided my decision to pursue a technical career. I consistently performed well and was actively involved in academic and co-curricular activities. <br> <br>
            4. During my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in programming and web development. I have hands-on experience with Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and ASP.NET, and I constantly strive to enhance my skills to stay current in the tech industry. My technical interests lie in full-stack development, embedded systems, and IoT-based solutions. <br><br>
            5.<mark> had the opportunity to intern at Dibble Tech Private Limited </mark>, where I gained real-world experience by developing web applications using Angular. I was responsible for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces, integrating RESTful APIs, and building reusable Angular components to ensure maintainability and scalability of the codebase. This internship helped me build a strong practical understanding of software development workflows and frontend-backend interaction.
            6.One of my key academic projects was the Accident Information System using GPS and GSM sensors, designed to identify accident locations and immediately alert emergency services via SMS. The system utilizes MEMS sensors, GSM modules, and GPS integrated with an Arduino to automate accident detection and reporting. This project aimed to reduce response time in critical situations and highlighted my interest in applying technology for real-world problem-solving. <br><br>
            7.Beyond academics, I am a confident, self-driven individual who thrives in team environments and enjoys taking on new challenges. I am fluent in English, Telugu, and Hindi, which helps me collaborate effectively in diverse teams. My long-term goal is to become a successful software developer, continuously learning and contributing to impactful projects. <br><br>
            8.Currently, <mark>I’m seeking an opportunity in a reputed software organization</mark> where I can contribute meaningfully, grow professionally, and be part of a team working on innovative technologies.
